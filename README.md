# Source Code for OWD.LI 

OWD.LI is a lightweight ink shortener service for [One Word Domains](https://www.oneword.domains), built in Flask and hosted on Vercel.

Shoutout to [An](https://github.com/anthemaker) for such a cool domain suggestion!

For context, OWD is the acronym of One Word Domains and LI is a cool reference to the HTML element `<li>` which is basically the premise of One Word Domains.
